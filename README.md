<img src="./notes/img/aws-certifications.png" alt="AWS certifications" width="600px">

## Description

**This repository contains resources from my work on the [AWS Developer Associate certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/). It's mostly notes right now, but after I pass the exam, I will add more code examples.**

I created the repository with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
~/dev/aws
❯ gh repo create awsdev -d "AWS Developer Associate Certification" \
  --enable-issues=false --enable-wiki=false --public
```

```
✓ Created repository br3ndonland/awsdev on GitHub
? Create a local project directory for br3ndonland/awsdev? Yes
✓ Initialized repository in './awsdev/'
```
