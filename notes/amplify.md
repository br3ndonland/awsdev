# AWS Amplify

## Benefits

- [Custom Domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html)
- [Web Previews](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/pr-previews.html): generate ephemeral preview environments for PRs

## Questions

- You can't add a custom domain until after the application is deployed. What if I need to keep the application off the public internet and within my organization's AWS environment at all times?
