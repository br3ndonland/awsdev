### S3 definition

- S3 is AWS **Simple Storage Service**.
- S3 is **object storage**, as opposed to file or block storage.

### Objects

- **Objects** are like files.
- Objects consist of:
  - Key (name)
  - Value (data)
  - Version ID
  - Metadata
- S3 objects can be as small as 0 bytes _(potential exam question)_
- S3 objects can be as large as 5 TB _(potential exam question)_

### Buckets

- **Buckets hold objects**.
- Buckets have global namespace (like domain names)

### Storage classes

- [S3 storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) offer tradeoffs among availability, durability, retrieval time, and price.
- **Intelligent tiering**
  - Machine learning assigns buckets to the best access tier.
- **Standard**
  - 11 9s availability (99.99999999999%)
- **Standard Infrequently Accessed (IA)**
  - 50% cheaper than standard
  - For objects accessed less than once per month
- **One-Zone IA**dafdsadf sda
  - 99.5% availability
  - 70% cheaper than standard, 20% cheaper than Standard IA
- **Glacier**
  - Low cost
  - Retrieval takes hours
- **Glacier Deep Archive**
  - Lowest cost
  - 12 hour retrieval time

## Deploying static sites with S3

- Disadvantages:
  - Not atomic
  - Not Git-centric
- Alternatives:
  - AWS Amplify Console
  - Netlify
  - Vercel
- From [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/):
  > With FTP or S3 uploads, each file is just pushed live one after the other, so you can easily get into situations where a new HTML page is live before the supporting assets (images, scripts, CSS) have been uploaded. And if your connection cuts out in the middle of an upload, your site could get stuck in a broken state for a long time.
  >
  > Atomic deploys guarantee that your site is always consistent.
