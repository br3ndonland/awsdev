### CLI

- I decided to follow the best practice:
  - Only use the root user to create an IAM user
  - Create an Admin IAM group
  - Create a user and add to Admin IAM group (my user is brendon)
  - Authenticate with the admin user for all daily tasks
- I did the follow-along, setting up the CLI with `aws configure`
